# Phase 2 - Target Repo Adapter Kit

## P2.1 Adapter Onboarding Guide

1. [ ] Create a target-repo onboarding guide that describes minimal adapter patch requirements.
2. [ ] Include required touch points (`.envrc`, `devenv.nix`, dev wrappers, verification scripts).
3. [ ] Document compatibility strategy for legacy/product-specific env names.

## P2.2 Constructor Output Expectations

1. [ ] Define what `/construct-superloop` should verify before declaring a target repo contract-ready.
2. [ ] Specify required evidence artifacts for contract adoption in a target repo.

## P2.3 Examples

1. [ ] Add one concrete migration example from product-specific naming to canonical naming.
2. [ ] Add one exception example for intentionally raw localhost test scripts.

## P2.V Validation

1. [ ] Confirm onboarding checklist is executable as-is by an engineer unfamiliar with this repo.
2. [ ] Confirm examples match the canonical contract spec language exactly.
