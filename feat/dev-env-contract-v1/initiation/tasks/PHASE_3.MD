# Phase 3 - Enforcement, Rollout, Deprecation

## P3.1 Enforcement Strategy

1. [ ] Define automated checks to flag new hardcoded localhost/port assumptions in orchestration-critical scripts.
2. [ ] Define explicit allowlist criteria and ownership for exceptions.
3. [ ] Document failure handling when contract violations are detected.

## P3.2 Rollout Plan

1. [ ] Define phased rollout order (pilot repos -> broader target set).
2. [ ] Define entry/exit criteria for each rollout wave.
3. [ ] Define rollback procedure for contract-related regressions.

## P3.3 Deprecation Policy

1. [ ] Define objective criteria for removing legacy aliases after adoption.
2. [ ] Define communication and timeline requirements before alias removal.

## P3.V Validation

1. [ ] Verify rollout/deprecation criteria are testable and unambiguous.
2. [ ] Ensure the initiation issue scope links all phase files and current PR links.
